# Lake Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the behavior of water in a lake and its effects on a dam. The simulation accounts for various factors such as wind-induced waves and the structural integrity of the dam. It aims to model how water interacts with a dam, potentially causing overflow or even dam failure under certain conditions.

The project is written in Ruby and is a command-line application. It provides an easy way for users to create their own lakes, customize dam properties, and test different scenarios to observe how water levels and external conditions affect the system.

## Features

- **Lake creation**: Easily create a lake with customizable water levels.
- **Wind effects**: Incorporate waves caused by wind and observe their impact on water levels.
- **Rainfall and overflow**: Simulate excessive rainfall and the possibility of dam overflow.
- **Dam failure**: Model the potential collapse of a dam when the pressure from the lake's water becomes too great.

## Requirements

- Ruby version 2.7 or higher.
- No external dependencies are required for basic functionality.
